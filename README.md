# Log File Manager

This Java program is made to take in (through std input) large files of outputs that you might see produced when a piece of software is running.

LogFileManager uses efficient searching algorithms to search these log files by category, keyword, and timestamp.

Using a built in command-line handler and a set of valid arguments, a user can search through large output files and retrieve excerpts from the file.

A user can then sort this excerpt list to their liking givin more command line arguments.

See spec-test-log.txt for a small sample logfile that might be processed.
